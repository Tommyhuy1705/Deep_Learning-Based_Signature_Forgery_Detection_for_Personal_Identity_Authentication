# Deep Learning-Based_Signature Forgery Detection for Personal Identity Authentication
## Introduction  

Handwritten signature remains one of the most widely used biometric modalities for identity verification in various real-world applications, particularly in secure domains such as banking, legal document authentication, and personal identification. However, signature forgery both skilled and unskilled poses a significant threat to the reliability of such systems. Traditional approaches often struggle to generalize well across diverse writing styles and varying levels of forgery.
This project explores deep learning-based approaches to address the problem of offline signature verification and forgery detection. Specifically, we investigate and compare three powerful models:

- Siamese Network + Contrastive Loss + ResNet34: A pairwise metric learning model that learns to distinguish genuine and forged signatures by minimizing the distance between similar pairs and maximizing it for dissimilar ones.
- Triplet Network + Triplet Loss + ResNet34: A relative distance learning framework that pushes genuine signature pairs closer while pushing forgeries further apart using anchor-positive-negative triplets.

All models are trained and tested on public benchmark datasets, and their performance is compared based on verification accuracy, forgery detection rate, generalization to unseen users, and embedding visualization.

The goal of this research is to develop robust, scalable, and intelligent verification systems that can be reliably deployed in real-world identity authentication workflows, minimizing the risk of signature-based fraud.
