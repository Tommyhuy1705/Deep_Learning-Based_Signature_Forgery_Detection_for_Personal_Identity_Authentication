# Deep_Learning-Based_Signature_Forgery_Detection_for_Personal_Identity_Authentication
This research investigates deep learning-based signature forgery detection using Siamese and Triplet Networks with ResNet50. A third model with ArcFace Loss is proposed. Models are compared on accuracy and robustness for personal identity authentication in secure domains.
